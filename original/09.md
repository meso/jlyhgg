We've mentioned that Haskell is a purely functional language.
Whereas in imperative languages you usually get things done by giving the computer a series of steps to execute,
functional programming is more of defining what stuff is.
In Haskell, a function can't change some state,
like changing the contents of a variable (when a function changes state,
we say that the function has side-effects).
The only thing a function can do in Haskell is give us back some result based on the parameters we gave it.
If a function is called two times with the same parameters, it has to return the same result.
While this may seem a bit limiting when you're coming from an imperative world,
we've seen that it's actually really cool.
In an imperative language,
you have no guarantee that a simple function 
that should just crunch some numbers won't burn down your house,
kidnap your dog and scratch your car with a potato while crunching those numbers.
For instance, when we were making a binary search tree,
we didn't insert an element into a tree by modifying some tree in place.
Our function for inserting into a binary search tree actually returned a new tree,
because it can't change the old one.

While functions being unable to change state is good 
because it helps us reason about our programs, there's one problem with that.
If a function can't change anything in the world,
how is it supposed to tell us what it calculated?
In order to tell us what it calculated,
it has to change the state of an output device 
(usually the state of the screen),
which then emits photons that travel to our brain 
and change the state of our mind, man.

Do not despair, all is not lost.
It turns out that Haskell actually has a really clever system for dealing with functions 
that have side-effects that neatly separates the part of our program 
that is pure and the part of our program 
that is impure, which does all the dirty work like talking to the keyboard and the screen.
With those two parts separated,
we can still reason about our pure program and take advantage of all the things that purity offers,
like laziness, robustness and modularity while efficiently communicating with the outside world.



## <a name="9.1">Hello, world!</a>

<img src="//s3.amazonaws.com/lyah/helloworld.png" alt="挿絵 HELLO!" class="img-left">

Up until now, we've always loaded our functions into GHCI to test them out and play with them.
We've also explored the standard library functions that way.
But now, after eight or so chapters,
we're finally going to write our first real Haskell program!
Yay! And sure enough,
we're going to do the good old "hello, world" schtick.

Hey! For the purposes of this chapter, I'm going to assume you're using a unix-y environment for learning Haskell.
If you're in Windows, I'd suggest you download Cygwin, which is a Linux-like environment for Windows, A.K.A.
just what you need.

So, for starters,
punch in the following in your favorite text editor:

    main = putStrLn "hello, world"

We just defined a name called main and in it we call a function called putStrLn with the parameter "hello, world".
Looks pretty much run of the mill, but it isn't, as we'll see in just a few moments.
Save that file as helloworld.hs.

And now, we're going to do something we've never done before.
We're actually going to compile our program!
I'm so excited!
Open up your terminal 
and navigate to the directory where helloworld.hs is located and do the following:

    $ ghc --make helloworld
    [1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( helloworld.hs, helloworld.o )
    Linking helloworld ...

Okay! With any luck,
you got something like this 
and now you can run your program by doing ./helloworld.

    $ ./helloworld
    hello, world

And there we go,
our first compiled program that printed out something to the terminal.
How extraordinarily boring!

Let's examine what we wrote.
First, let's look at the type of the function putStrLn.

    ghci> :t putStrLn
    putStrLn :: String -> IO ()
    ghci> :t putStrLn "hello, world"
    putStrLn "hello, world" :: IO ()

We can read the type of putStrLn like this:
putStrLn takes a string and returns an I/O action that has a result type of () (i.e.
the empty tuple, also know as unit).
An I/O action is something that,
when performed, will carry out an action with a side-effect 
(that's usually either reading from the input or printing stuff to the screen)
and will also contain some kind of return value inside it.
Printing a string to the terminal doesn't really have any kind of meaningful return value,
so a dummy value of () is used.

The empty tuple is a value of () and it also has a type of ().
So, when will an I/O action be performed?
Well, this is where main comes in.
An I/O action will be performed when we give it a name of main 
and then run our program.

Having your whole program be just one I/O action seems kind of limiting.
That's why we can use do syntax to glue together several I/O actions into one.
Take a look at the following example:

    main = do
        putStrLn "Hello, what's your name?"
        name <- getLine
        putStrLn ("Hey " ++ name ++ ", you rock!")

Ah, interesting, new syntax! And this reads pretty much like an imperative program.
If you compile it and try it out, it will probably behave just like you expect it to.
Notice that we said do and then we laid out a series of steps, like we would in an imperative program.
Each of these steps is an I/O action.
By putting them together with do syntax, we glued them into one I/O action.
The action that we got has a type of IO (), because that's the type of the last I/O action inside.

Because of that, main always has a type signature of main :: IO something, where something is some concrete type.
By convention, we don't usually specify a type declaration for main.

An interesting thing that we haven't met before is the third line, which states name <- getLine.
It looks like it reads a line from the input and stores it into a variable called name.
Does it really?
Well, let's examine the type of getLine.

    ghci> :t getLine
    getLine :: IO String
    luggage

Aha, o-kay.
getLine is an I/O action that contains a result type of String.
That makes sense,
because it will wait for the user to input something at the terminal 
and then that something will be represented as a string.
So what's up with name <- getLine then?
You can read that piece of code like this:
perform the I/O action getLine and then bind its result value to name.
getLine has a type of IO String, so name will have a type of String.
You can think of an I/O action 
as a box with little feet that will go out into the real world and do something there (
like write some graffiti on a wall) and maybe bring back some data.
Once it's fetched that data for you,
the only way to open the box and get the data inside it is to use the <- construct.
And if we're taking data out of an I/O action, we can only take it out when we're inside another I/O action.
This is how Haskell manages to neatly separate the pure and impure parts of our code.
getLine is in a sense impure because its result value is not guaranteed to be the same when performed twice.
That's why it's sort of tainted with the IO type constructor and we can only get that data out in I/O code.
And because I/O code is tainted too, any computation that depends on tainted I/O data will have a tainted result.

When I say tainted,
I don't mean tainted in such a way 
that we can never use the result contained in an I/O action ever again in pure code.
No, we temporarily un-taint the data inside an I/O action when we bind it to a name.
When we do name <- getLine, name is just a normal string, because it represents what's inside the box.
We can have a really complicated function that,
say, takes your name (a normal string) as a parameter 
and tells you your fortune and your whole life's future based on your name.
We can do this:

    main = do
        putStrLn "Hello, what's your name?"
        name <- getLine
        putStrLn $ "Read this carefully, because this is your future: " ++ tellFortune name

and tellFortune 
(or any of the functions it passes name to)
doesn't have to know anything about I/O,
it's just a normal String -> String function!

Take a look at this piece of code.
Is it valid?

    nameTag = "Hello, my name is " ++ getLine

If you said no, go eat a cookie.
If you said yes, drink a bowl of molten lava.
Just kidding, don't!
The reason that this doesn't work is that ++ requires both its parameters to be lists over the same type.
The left parameter has a type of String (or [Char] if you will), whilst getLine has a type of IO String.
You can't concatenate a string and an I/O action.
We first have to get the result out of the I/O action to get a value of type String 
and the only way to do that is to say something like name <- getLine inside some other I/O action.
If we want to deal with impure data, we have to do it in an impure environment.
So the taint of impurity spreads around much like the undead scourge 
and it's in our best interest to keep the I/O parts of our code as small as possible.

Every I/O action that gets performed has a result encapsulated within it.
That's why our previous example program could also have been written like this:

    main = do
        foo <- putStrLn "Hello, what's your name?"
        name <- getLine
        putStrLn ("Hey " ++ name ++ ", you rock!")

However, foo would just have a value of (), so doing that would be kind of moot.
Notice that we didn't bind the last putStrLn to anything.
That's because in a do block, the last action cannot be bound to a name like the first two were.
We'll see exactly why that is so a bit later when we venture off into the world of monads.
For now, you can think of it in the way 
that the do block automatically extracts the value from the last action and binds it to its own result.

Except for the last line, every line in a do block that doesn't bind can also be written with a bind.
So putStrLn "BLAH" can be written as _ <- putStrLn "BLAH".
But that's useless,
so we leave out the <- for I/O actions 
that don't contain an important result, like putStrLn something.

Beginners sometimes think that doing

    name = getLine

will read from the input and then bind the value of that to name.
Well, it won't, all this does is give the getLine I/O action a different name called, well, name.
Remember, to get the value out of an I/O action,
you have to perform it inside another I/O action by binding it to a name with <-.

I/O actions will only be performed when they are given a name of main 
or when they're inside a bigger I/O action that we composed with a do block.
We can also use a do block to glue together a few I/O actions 
and then we can use that I/O action in another do block and so on.
Either way, they'll be performed only if they eventually fall into main.

Oh, right, there's also one more case when I/O actions will be performed.
When we type out an I/O action in GHCI and press return, it will be performed.

    ghci> putStrLn "HEEY"
    HEEY

Even when we just punch out a number or call a function in GHCI and press return,
it will evaluate it (as much as it needs) 
and then call show on it and then it will print that string to the terminal using putStrLn implicitly.

Remember let bindings? If you don't, refresh your memory on them by reading this section.
They have to be in the form of let bindings in expression,
where bindings are names to be given to expressions 
and expression is the expression that is to be evaluated that sees them.
We also said that in list comprehensions, the in part isn't needed.
Well, you can use them in do blocks pretty much like you use them in list comprehensions.
Check this out:

    import Data.Char
    
    main = do
        putStrLn "What's your first name?"
        firstName <- getLine
        putStrLn "What's your last name?"
        lastName <- getLine
        let bigFirstName = map toUpper firstName
            bigLastName = map toUpper lastName
        putStrLn $ "hey " ++ bigFirstName ++ " " ++ bigLastName ++ ", how are you?"

See how the I/O actions in the do block are lined up?
Also notice how the let is lined up with the I/O actions and the names of the let are lined up with each other?
That's good practice, because indentation is important in Haskell.
Now, we did map toUpper firstName, which turns something like "John" into a much cooler string like "JOHN".
We bound that uppercased string to a name and then used it in a string later on that we printed to the terminal.

You may be wondering when to use <- and when to use let bindings?
Well, remember, <- is (for now) for performing I/O actions and binding their results to names.
map toUpper firstName, however, isn't an I/O action.
It's a pure expression in Haskell.
So use <- when you want to bind results of I/O actions to names 
and you can use let bindings to bind pure expressions to names.
Had we done something like let firstName = getLine,
we would have just called the getLine I/O action a different name 
and we'd still have to run it through a <- to perform it.

Now we're going to make a program 
that continuously reads a line and prints out the same line with the words reversed.
The program's execution will stop when we input a blank line.
This is the program:

    main = do
        line <- getLine
        if null line
            then return ()
            else do
                putStrLn $ reverseWords line
                main
    
    reverseWords :: String -> String
    reverseWords = unwords . map reverse . words

To get a feel of what it does,
you can run it before we go over the code.

> Protip: To run a program you can either compile it 
> and then run the produced executable file by doing ghc --make helloworld 
> and then ./helloworld or you can use the runhaskell command like so:
> runhaskell helloworld.hs and your program will be executed on the fly.

First, let's take a look at the reverseWords function.
It's just a normal function that takes a string like 
"hey there man" and then calls words with it to produce a list of words like ["hey","there","man"].
Then we map reverse on the list,
getting ["yeh","ereht","nam"] 
and then we put that back into one string by using unwords and the final result is "yeh ereht nam".
See how we used function composition here.
Without function composition,
we'd have to write something like reverseWords st = unwords (map reverse (words st)).

What about main? First, we get a line from the terminal by performing getLine call that line line.
And now, we have a conditional expression.
Remember that in Haskell,
 every if must have a corresponding else because every expression has to have some sort of value.
We make the if so that when a condition is true (in our case,
the line that we entered is blank),
 we perform one I/O action and when it isn't, the I/O action under the else is performed.
That's why in an I/O do block, ifs have to have a form of if condition then I/O action else I/O action.

Let's first take a look at what happens under the else clause.
Because, we have to have exactly one I/O action after the else,
we use a do block to glue together two I/O actions into one.
You could also write that part out as:

    else (do
        putStrLn $ reverseWords line
        main)

This makes it more explicit that the do block can be viewed as one I/O action, but it's uglier.
Anyway, inside the do block,
we call reverseWords on the line that we got from getLine and then print that out to the terminal.
After that, we just perform main.
It's called recursively and that's okay, because main is itself an I/O action.
So in a sense, we go back to the start of the program.

Now what happens when null line holds true? What's after the then is performed in that case.
If we look up, we'll see that it says then return ().
If you've done imperative languages like C, Java or Python,
you're probably thinking that you know what this return does 
and chances are you've already skipped this really long paragraph.
Well, here's the thing:
the return in Haskell is really nothing like the return in most other languages!
It has the same name, which confuses a lot of people,
but in reality it's quite different.
In imperative languages,
return usually ends the execution of a method 
or subroutine and makes it report some sort of value to whoever called it.
In Haskell (in I/O actions specifically), it makes an I/O action out of a pure value.
If you think about the box analogy from before, it takes a value and wraps it up in a box.
The resulting I/O action doesn't actually do anything, it just has that value encapsulated as its result.
So in an I/O context, return "haha" will have a type of IO String.
What's the point of just transforming a pure value into an I/O action that doesn't do anything?
Why taint our program with IO more than it has to be?
Well, we needed some I/O action to carry out in the case of an empty input line.
That's why we just made a bogus I/O action that doesn't do anything by writing return ().

Using return doesn't cause the I/O do block to end in execution or anything like that.
For instance, this program will quite happily carry out all the way to the last line:

    main = do
        return ()
        return "HAHAHA"
        line <- getLine
        return "BLAH BLAH BLAH"
        return 4
        putStrLn line

All these returns do is that they make I/O actions 
that don't really do anything except have an encapsulated result 
and that result is thrown away because it isn't bound to a name.
We can use return in combination with <- to bind stuff to names.

    main = do
        a <- return "hell"
        b <- return "yeah!"
        putStrLn $ a ++ " " ++ b

So you see, return is sort of the opposite to <-.
While return takes a value and wraps it up in a box, <- takes a box (
and performs it) and takes the value out of it, binding it to a name.
But doing this is kind of redundant,
especially since you can use let bindings in do blocks to bind to names, like so:

    main = do
        let a = "hell"
            b = "yeah"
        putStrLn $ a ++ " " ++ b

When dealing with I/O do blocks,
we mostly use return either because we need to create an I/O action that doesn't do anything 
or because we don't want the I/O action 
that's made up from a do block to have the result value of its last action,
but we want it to have a different result value,
so we use return to make an I/O action that always has our desired result contained and we put it at the end.

A do block can also have just one I/O action.
In that case, it's the same as just writing the I/O action.
Some people would prefer writing then do return () in this case because the else also has a do.
Before we move on to files, let's take a look at some functions that are useful when dealing with I/O.

putStr is much like putStrLn in that it takes a string as a parameter 
and returns an I/O action that will print that string to the terminal,
only putStr doesn't jump into a new line after printing out the string while putStrLn does.

    main = do   putStr "Hey, "
                putStr "I'm "
                putStrLn "Andy!"
    $ runhaskell putstr_test.hs
    Hey, I'm Andy!

Its type signature is putStr :: String -> IO (),
so the result encapsulated within the resulting I/O action is the unit.
A dud value, so it doesn't make sense to bind it.

putChar takes a character and returns an I/O action that will print it out to the terminal.

    main = do   putChar 't'
                putChar 'e'
                putChar 'h'
    
    $ runhaskell putchar_test.hs
    teh

putStr is actually defined recursively with the help of putChar.
The edge condition of putStr is the empty string,
so if we're printing an empty string, just return an I/O action that does nothing by using return ().
If it's not empty, then print the first character of the string by doing putChar 
and then print of them using putStr.

    putStr :: String -> IO ()
    putStr [] = return ()
    putStr (x:xs) = do
        putChar x
        putStr xs

See how we can use recursion in I/O, just like we can use it in pure code.
Just like in pure code, we define the edge case and then think what the result actually is.
It's an action that first outputs the first character and then outputs the rest of the string.

print takes a value of any type that's an instance of Show 
(meaning that we know how to represent it as a string),
calls show with that value to stringify it and then outputs that string to the terminal.
Basically, it's just putStrLn .
show.
It first runs show on a value 
and then feeds that to putStrLn,
which returns an I/O action that will print out our value.

    main = do   print True
                print 2
                print "haha"
                print 3.2
                print [3,4,3]
    
    $ runhaskell print_test.hs
    True
    2
    "haha"
    3.2
    [3,4,3]

As you can see, it's a very handy function.
Remember how we talked about how I/O actions are performed only 
when they fall into main or when we try to evaluate them in the GHCI prompt?
When we type out a value (like 3 or [1,2,3]) and press the return key,
GHCI actually uses print on that value to display it on our terminal!

    ghci> 3
    3
    ghci> print 3
    3
    ghci> map (++"!") ["hey","ho","woo"]
    ["hey!","ho!","woo!"]
    ghci> print (map (++"!") ["hey","ho","woo"])
    ["hey!","ho!","woo!"]

When we want to print out strings,
we usually use putStrLn 
because we don't want the quotes around them,
but for printing out values of other types to the terminal, print is used the most.

getChar is an I/O action that reads a character from the input.
Thus, its type signature is getChar :: IO Char, because the result contained within the I/O action is a Char.
Note that due to buffering, reading of the characters won't actually happen until the user mashes the return key.

    main = do
        c <- getChar
        if c /= ' '
            then do
                putChar c
                main
            else return ()

This program looks like it should read a character and then check if it's a space.
If it is, halt execution and if it isn't, print it to the terminal and then do the same thing all over again.
Well, it kind of does, only not in the way you might expect.
Check this out:

    $ runhaskell getchar_test.hs
    hello sir
    hello

The second line is the input.
We input hello sir and then press return.
Due to buffering,
the execution of the program will begin only when after we've hit return and not after every inputted character.
But once we press return, it acts on what we've been putting in so far.
Try playing with this program to get a feel for it!

The when function is found in Control.Monad (to get access to it, do import Control.Monad).
It's interesting because in a do block it looks like a control flow statement,
but it's actually a normal function.
It takes a boolean value and an I/O action if that boolean value is True,
it returns the same I/O action that we supplied to it.
However, if it's False, it returns the return (), action, so an I/O action that doesn't do anything.
Here's how we could rewrite the previous piece of code with which we demonstrated getChar by using when:

import Control.Monad

main = do
    c <- getChar
    when (c /= ' ') $ do
        putChar c
        main

So as you can see, it's useful for encapsulating the if something then do some I/O action else return () pattern.

sequence takes a list of I/O actions and returns an I/O actions 
that will perform those actions one after the other.
The result contained in that I/O action will be a list of the results of all the I/O actions that were performed.
Its type signature is sequence :: [IO a] -> IO [a].
Doing this:

    main = do
        a <- getLine
        b <- getLine
        c <- getLine
        print [a,b,c]

Is exactly the same as doing this:.

    main = do
        rs <- sequence [getLine, getLine, getLine]
        print rs

So sequence [getLine, getLine, getLine] makes an I/O action that will perform getLine three times.
If we bind that action to a name,
the result is a list of all the results,
so in our case, a list of three things that the user entered at the prompt.

A common pattern with sequence is when we map functions like print or putStrLn over lists.
Doing map print [1,2,3,4] won't create an I/O action.
It will create a list of I/O actions, because that's like writing [print 1, print 2, print 3, print 4].
If we want to transform that list of I/O actions into an I/O action, we have to sequence it.

    ghci> sequence (map print [1,2,3,4,5])
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    [(),(),(),(),()]

What's with the [(),(),(),(),()] at the end?
Well, when we evaluate an I/O action in GHCI,
it's performed and then its result is printed out, unless that result is (), in which case it's not printed out.
That's why evaluating putStrLn "hehe" in GHCI just prints out hehe (
because the contained result in putStrLn "hehe" is ()).
But when we do getLine in GHCI,
the result of that I/O action is printed out, because getLine has a type of IO String.

Because mapping a function that returns an I/O action over a list and then sequencing it is so common,
the utility functions mapM and mapM_ were introduced.
mapM takes a function and a list, maps the function over the list and then sequences it.
mapM_ does the same, only it throws away the result later.
We usually use mapM_ when we don't care what result our sequenced I/O actions have.

    ghci> mapM print [1,2,3]
    1
    2
    3
    [(),(),()]
    ghci> mapM_ print [1,2,3]
    1
    2
    3

forever takes an I/O action and returns an I/O action that just repeats the I/O action it got forever.
It's located in Control.Monad.
This little program will indefinitely ask the user for some input and spit it back to him, CAPSLOCKED:

    import Control.Monad
    import Data.Char
    
    main = forever $ do
        putStr "Give me some input: "
        l <- getLine
        putStrLn $ map toUpper l

forM (located in Control.Monad) is like mapM, only that it has its parameters switched around.
The first parameter is the list and the second one is the function to map over that list, which is then sequenced.
Why is that useful?
Well, with some creative use of lambdas and do notation, we can do stuff like this:

    import Control.Monad
    
    main = do
        colors <- forM [1,2,3,4] (\a -> do
            putStrLn $ "Which color do you associate with the number " ++ show a ++ "?"
            color <- getLine
            return color)
        putStrLn "The colors that you associate with 1, 2, 3 and 4 are: "
        mapM putStrLn colors

The (\a -> do ...
) is a function that takes a number and returns an I/O action.
We have to surround it with parentheses, otherwise the lambda thinks the last two I/O actions belong to it.
Notice that we do return color in the inside do block.
We do that so that the I/O action which the do block defines has the result of our color contained within it.
We actually didn't have to do that, because getLine already has that contained within it.
Doing color <- getLine 
and then return color is just unpacking the result from getLine and then repackaging it again,
so it's the same as just doing getLine.
The forM (called with its two parameters) produces an I/O action, whose result we bind to colors.
colors is just a normal list that holds strings.
At the end, we print out all those colors by doing mapM putStrLn colors.

You can think of forM as meaning: make an I/O action for every element in this list.
What each I/O action will do can depend on the element that was used to make the action.
Finally, perform those actions and bind their results to something.
We don't have to bind it, we can also just throw it away.

    $ runhaskell form_test.hs
    Which color do you associate with the number 1?
    white
    Which color do you associate with the number 2?
    blue
    Which color do you associate with the number 3?
    red
    Which color do you associate with the number 4?
    orange
    The colors that you associate with 1, 2, 3 and 4 are:
    white
    blue
    red
    orange

We could have actually done that without forM, only with forM it's more readable.
Normally we write forM when we want to map 
and sequence some actions that we define there on the spot using do notation.
In the same vein, we could have replaced the last line with forM colors putStrLn.

In this section, we learned the basics of input and output.
We also found out what I/O actions are,
how they enable us to do input and output and when they are actually performed.
To reiterate, I/O actions are values much like any other value in Haskell.
We can pass them as parameters to functions and functions can return I/O actions as results.
What's special about them is that if they fall into the main function 
(or are the result in a GHCI line),
they are performed.
And that's when they get to write stuff on your screen or play Yakety Sax through your speakers.
Each I/O action can also encapsulate a result with which it tells you what it got from the real world.

Don't think of a function like putStrLn as a function that takes a string and prints it to the screen.
Think of it as a function that takes a string and returns an I/O action.
That I/O action will, when performed, print beautiful poetry to your terminal.

getChar is an I/O action that reads a single character from the terminal.
getLine is an I/O action that reads a line from the terminal.
These two are pretty straightforward 
and most programming languages have some functions or statements that are parallel to them.
But now, let's meet getContents.
getContents is an I/O action 
that reads everything from the standard input until it encounters an end-of-file character.
Its type is getContents :: IO String.
What's cool about getContents is that it does lazy I/O.
When we do foo <- getContents,
it doesn't read all of the input at once, store it in memory and then bind it to foo.
No, it's lazy!
It'll say: "Yeah yeah, I'll read the input from the terminal later as we go along, when you really need it!".

getContents is really useful when we're piping the output from one program into the input of our program.
In case you don't know how piping works in unix-y systems, here's a quick primer.
Let's make a text file that contains the following little haiku:

    I'm a lil' teapot
    What's with that airplane food, huh?
    It's so small, tasteless

Yeah, the haiku sucks, what of it?
If anyone knows of any good haiku tutorials, let me know.

Now, recall the little program we wrote when we were introducing the forever function.
It prompted the user for a line, returned it to him in CAPSLOCK and then did that all over again, indefinitely.
Just so you don't have to scroll all the way back, here it is again:
