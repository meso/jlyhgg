# Learn You a Haskell for Great Good! - Japanese version


You're ready to learn Haskell but you are not good at English?
Never mind!
I'm working on translating the most funkiest way to learn Haskell written by Miran Lipovača into Japanese.
Please visit at:

* [https://moutend.github.io/jlyhgg/](https://moutend.github.io/jlyhgg/)



## Motivation

To improve my English and learn Haskell.
So the quality of translation,
correctness of terms,
natural Japanese representations and fun of jokes are not guaranteed.

If you are looking for a reliable tutorial written in Japanese,
I recommend you to read a official Japanese version of LYHGG called
[すごいHaskellたのしく学ぼう！](https://estore.ohmsha.co.jp/titles/978427406885P)
at first.
Well, I think that thousand of sophisticated jokes are difficult part of translation.
It's not joke, really.



## Contributing

You can report the weird part of translation via Issues
or directly fix it and send Pull Request.
The markdown files that corresponding to each chapters are located in `chapters` directory.
And I appreciate your any contribution, any time.
