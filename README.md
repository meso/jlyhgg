# Learn You a Haskell for Great Good! - Japanese version


You're ready to learn Haskell but you are not good at English?
Never mind!
I'm working on translating the most funkiest way to learn Haskell written by Miran Lipovača into Japanese.
Please visit at:

* [https://moutend.github.io/jlyhgg/](https://moutend.github.io/jlyhgg/)



## Preview at local

You can also preview this tutorial on your machine.
(You need Ruby 2.1+ and bundler gem.)

```shell
git clone https://github.com/moutend/jlyhgg
cd ./jlyhgg
mkdir -p vendor/bundle
bundle install --path vendor/bundle
bundle exec jekyll server
```



## Motivation

To improve my English and learn Haskell.
So the quality of translation,
correctness of terms,
natural Japanese representations and fun of jokes are not guaranteed.

If you are looking for a reliable tutorial written in Japanese,
I recommend you to read a official Japanese version of LYHGG called
[すごいHaskellたのしく学ぼう！](https://estore.ohmsha.co.jp/titles/978427406885P)
at first.
Well, I think that thousand of sophisticated jokes are difficult part of translation.
It's not joke, really.



## Contributing

You can report the weird part of translation via Issues
or directly fix it and send Pull Request.
The markdown files that corresponding to each chapters are located in `chapters` directory.
And I appreciate your any contribution, any time.
